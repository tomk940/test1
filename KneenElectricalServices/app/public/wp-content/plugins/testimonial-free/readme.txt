<p><h4>Why Testimonials are important to your success?</h4>
Social Proof is one of six principles of Influence. People are especially susceptible to it when they’re feeling uncertain about a company or brand. When a potential customer lands on your site, how will they feel about your brand? Most website visitors don’t immediately trust a new brand. Hence the power of a great testimonial.</p>


<p><h4>Beautifully Designed Testimonial Layouts</h4>
Good Looking Testimonials equal to Good Looking Sales Reports. Sorry to say, but it’s true! Having a positive testimonial that looks ugly or out of date can end up resulting in a net gain of zero! This is why we’ve worked hard to give you the ability to create beautiful testimonials in an instant.</p>


<p><h4>Impress Potential Customers</h4>
A beautifully written and attractive looking testimonial from past happy customers reassures the potential customer that purchasing from your company is the right decision to make.</p>


<p><h4>Why We Made Testimonial</h4>
Thoughtfully designed testimonials, that look good from the get-go and were easy to create, have been a struggle for many WordPress users. Until now. Testimonials by ShapedPlugin designs are modern, sheik and very customizable, right out of the box. </p>
